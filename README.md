## **Introduction**
Taxi demand reflects the travel behavior preference of people in different locations at different times. Predicting taxi demand can help taxi companies to organize taxi fleet and also to help passengers and drivers to reduce waiting time. In the past, many researchers have used statistical methods to forecast taxi demands. In recent years, deep learning approaches have been demonstrated to learn various features and to explore the patterns behind large sets of data, which provides the new opportunity to learn the taxi demand pattern efficiently and effectively.


This thesis project will utilize the Long-Short Term Memory model, which is popular in deep learning, to find the pattern behind the taxi demand in New York City and then to predict the taxi demand using this pattern. The project will also predict the taxi demand using another regression model XGBoost model, which is powerful in machine learning. Various evaluation methods will be conducted on these two models, and the results will be compared from different perspectives. Finally, observations from them will be concluded.
